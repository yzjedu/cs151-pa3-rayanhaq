I was supposed to learn/ accomplish how to Practice with protecting against bad user input, Practice with decision making, An opportunity to use looping Practice with designing functions Practice with implementing functions. The steps I followed were just the fundamentals. I tried my best to understanding the problem before creating a program.The key concpets were of the advanced string formatting for one of my random images. Yes the results matched everything. Just needed to make sure evreything was right before moving on. AS in making sure my circle function worked before working on the random image one. No test cases because they were not really needed. Challenges I encountered was with the advanced string formatting. This is because it was hard trying to format it the way I wanted too but in the end I was able too. Not really any key takeaways it was one of the easier labs. I believe I did learn and acomplish everything that was meant for this lab. It was not as bad I think it was going to be but working by my self but in the end I was able to finish this project. As well as a thank you to professor for letting me turn this in late. Really appreciate it.
